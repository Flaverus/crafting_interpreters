# JavaScript Lox Interpreter
## Approach
This Project was created alongside the Java implementation for a Lox Interpreter based on the book *"Crafting Interpreters"*. 
It follows a more "functional" approach with the usage of factory functions instead of classes.
## How to get started
### Requirements
You need node.js installed to be able to run the project
### Running the Project
To run the project and write Lox code in the terminal simply run `node src/lox.js` and write your Lox code. Hit enter to run your code

If you'd like to run a *.lox* file run `node src/Lox.js path/to/file.lox` (E.g. `node src/Lox.js loxfiles/one.lox`)
